  <ul>
    <li><div>
      <div class="front darker char1"><div>Tony Loneman</div></div>
      <div class="back darker"><div>A 21-year-old of Cheyenne descent, living in Oakland. Throughout this Novel Tony struggles with how his identity functions with the larger society he lives in. We are first introduced to him with his fetal alcohol syndrome, which has caused noticeable face dysmorphia. He struggles between either tucking himself behind this face and living as he is expected to, or looking past it into himself, and enabling his own identity over the judgement of others. This conflict indicates his larger struggle he faces between an “assimilated life”, where he is meant to repress his Native descent and a free life, where his identity is both invisible to the world yet present for himself. </div></div>
    </div></li>
    <li><div>
      <div class="front lighter"><div>Dene Oxendene</div></div>
      <div class="back lighter"><div>A young documentary filmmaker, of Cheyenne descent, living in Oakland. Throughout the novel, Dene is continuing a project to film Native American stories that his uncle left behind when he passed away. With this, Dene faces challenges of understanding, adopting, and growing from both his own and other native American’s legacies, as he felt among this transaction was the need to continue their stories. The personal pressure of this role manifests in the critical and fixated way he perceives all his interactions, both with himself and the world. His understanding of how to honor and apply this weight is further complicated as both his uncle, his project, and his death were ultimately entangled with alcoholism.</div></div>
    </div></li>
    <li><div>
      <div class="front long"><div>Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield</div></div>
      <div class="back"><div>A middle-aged woman, of Cheyenne descent, living in Oakland, who cares for her sister’s three grandchildren. During this novel, Opal struggles with a rejection of Native American culture, both in its tangible repercussions and mental afflictions. After occupying Alcatraz with her mother and sister, Jacquie Red Feather, as part of a Native American political movement when she was a child, she has silently renounced her connection to her culture. She considers the life that follows a devotion to her culture to be full of pain, loss, and suffering, an array of consequences brought to life during her occupation and removal from the island. As she continues her life separate from her descent, she is challenged with loss of identity that it brings for her family and the consistent guilt and apprehensions that it brings to herself</div></div>
    </div></li>
    <li><div>
      <div class="front lighter"><div>Edwin Black</div></div>
      <div class="back lighter"><div>A young man, half white, half Native, living in Oakland. Edwin, like Tony struggles with his identity and specifically his qualification to be Native. In the beginning of the novel, we are introduced to him and his struggle with the Internet, which has taken over his life after he previously earned his master’s degree in comparative literature with a focus on Native American Literature. His inability to avoid the newly popularized internet, serves as a way for him to avoid engaging with his degree. This apprehension to critically engage with the work and and lives of Native Americans makes tangible his relationship and connection to his own culture. Not knowing his father, he feels that his half Native ancestry is only a title, not a description of who he is, or the qualifications he has. Even upon meeting with his father, he struggles to accept his own identity and place in the larger Native American community.  </div></div>
    </div></li>
    <li><div>
      <div class="front darker"><div>Bill Davis</div></div>
      <div class="back darker"><div>An older man, part of the Lakota People, living in Oakland and dating Edwin’s mother. Throughout the novel Bill is dissatisfied with the modernization of the world, and subsequently Native American people. Having served as the Janitor for the Big Oakland Powwow venue for years, he feels a certain distaste, and at times hostility towards the newer employees, newer ways of running the venue, and ultimately many newer ways of living. This conflict helps frame his struggle with Native culture, and his attempts to hold onto a “traditional Native life”. Both his resentment for Edwin’s refusal to engage with the culture and his commitment to preserving the grounds for Powwows further support this value. </div></div>
    </div></li>
    <li><div>
      <div class="front"><div>Calvin Johnson</div></div>
      <div class="back"><div>A young man, Native, living in Oakland with his sister. In this Novel Calvin’s beliefs and actions challenge those of Bill. Owing drug money and caught in a dangerous crime, he yearns to move on from his current life, and escape whatever pain was brought up in the past. This fixation on moving on, and his irrelevance to his own Native culture frames his desire to neither embrace nor reject the larger Native American narrative. His emphasis on the future, and its disconnection from his past further supports his values. However, as he pushes away from his current narrative, its pain, and long-standing obligations, as personified by his drug dues, restrict him. This battle between his moving on and his history continues to escalate and torture him throughout the Novel, eventually forcing him to decide which he must let go of. </div></div>
    </div></li>
    <li><div>
      <div class="front darker"><div>Jacquie Red Feather</div></div>
      <div class="back darker"><div>A Middle-aged Woman, Native, living in Oakland and half-sister of Opal. In this novel, Jacquie neither struggles with her identity, nor with baring, continuing, and moving on from a legacy. With this she becomes an agent to explore the present effects of alcoholism, mental and physical abuse, and anti-Native racism on the average person. In this Novel, Jacquie is in a position of ultimate loss, having lost faith in those who care for her, feelings of general trust, both her daughters and grandchildren, as well as her life to alcohol. Throughout all the events in There There, she struggles to remain whole and recovering. Her actions towards seeing her grandchildren again and recovering from alcoholism reflect a desire to simply live, framing her as a person forced to resist the years and layers of systemic oppression Native Americans have endured, simply to exist. </div></div>
    </div></li>
    <li><div>
      <div class="front"><div>Orvil Red Feather</div></div>
      <div class="back"><div>A fourteen-year-old boy of Cheyenne descent, grandson of Jacquie, living in Oakland under the care of Opal. Orvil, like Edwin Black, struggles with feelings of belonging. Growing up with Opal, he has never been exposed to his Native American culture, and so he feels lost whenever he does privately engage with it. However, unlike Edwin, he is eager to feel connected to this history, and works to get himself involved with it. This effort is seen specifically when he puts on Native Regalia, and dances in practice for the Big Oakland Powwow, as he is forced to completely accept and embrace his heritage. </div></div>
    </div></li>
    <li><div>
      <div class="front lighter"><div>Octavio Gomez</div></div>
      <div class="back lighter"><div>A Young Man, Native, living in Oakland, selling drugs with Calvin, Tony, and others. Octavio, like Jacquie does not specifically struggle with identity or legacy, but rather, works to create a valuable and safe life for himself and those that he cares about. Similar to Jacquie, he offers a space to explore how years of violence, oppressions and access to drugs in Native American communities effects the lives of average people. </div></div>
    </div></li>
    <li><div>
      <div class="front"><div>Daniel Gonzales</div></div>
      <div class="back"><div>A young Man, Native, living in Oakland, cousin of Octavio. After the death of his brother, he grew to become more independent and self-starting, learning multiple programming languages, 3D modeling, and other tech skills. This education becomes central to him as feels excluded from Octavio’s work and wishes to get involved with what his cousin does. His desire to help improve lives the way he sees Octavio do challenges him as he begins to more deeply understand the difficulties that comes with healing systemic Native Americans issues. </div></div>
    </div></li>
    <li><div>
      <div class="front darker"><div>Blue</div></div>
      <div class="back darker"><div>A middle-aged Woman, Native, adopted by a white family, married to a white man and head of the powwow committee. In the novel Blue both struggles with identity, and the violence and hostility she receives as a Native woman. Both Blue and those she interacts with become agents to expose how mental and physical abuse directed towards Native women displaces and overrides their being. This, along with how she was molded during her white upbringing contributes to her disconnect with self, as she engages with who she is, and how her environment has changed her own personal narrative, both physically and emotionally.</div></div>
    </div></li>
    <li><div>
      <div class="front"><div>Thomas Frank</div></div>
      <div class="back"><div>An older man, of Cheyenne Descent, who is playing as a drummer at the powwow. Throughout his life Thomas has always been a great at playing drums, and preforming. Although he has struggled with alcoholism, he finds a comfort in it, as it provides him a calm escape from the rest of his life. As the novel progresses, his own relationship with his Native culture is seen to align with his ability to enter this state, ultimately forcing himself to question what it means for him to identify as Native. </div></div>

    <div>There There, by Tommy Orange follows 12 Native Americans and their distinct yet connected narratives. The novel, set in Oakland, observers the events leading to, and of the Big Oakland Powwow from the changing perspective of each of these characters. Using voice, time, dialect, and perspective, Orange creates effective and compelling short stories with each of his characters as he slowly reveals their personal significance to the upcoming powwow. This slow build allows time to explore individual themes and conflicts, ultimately giving space to explore the legacy, continuation, and damage of social epidemics such as alcoholism and sexism. As the powwow draws closer however, these personal challenges create a larger picture for and against the modern Native American, offering space for contemplation as Orange masterfully pulls together the growing pool of tangled thread. 	</div>

  <div class="quote quote1">
    <span class="quotation">&ldquo;</span>acting normal, like they don't look what they look like. Indians dressed up as Indians." (233)
    <div class="dropdown-button">SEE MORE > <div class="quote-description">This quote engages with the novel’s look into identity and what it means to be Native American. Throughout this story, most of its characters are challenged with their own culture and what it means to be part of it, and although their approach to answering this varies, there is always an element of externality as part of identity. However, the narrator here, Orvil, challenges that, suggesting instead there is a critical distinction between being a normal Native American, and the act of  “dressing up as one”.  </div></div>
  </div>
  <div class="quote quote2">
    <span class="quotation">&ldquo;</span>When he turned on the camera, his uncle was with him, seeing through it.” (43)
    <div class="dropdown-button">SEE MORE > <div class="quote-description">This quotation, told from Dene, presents the novel’s challenging ideas of legacy. Throughout the novel, the weight of carrying the Native American narrative is viewed as an inconvenience, target, or something to be abandoned, such that it is ultimately framed as a cruel and unjust responsibility. Dene’s perspective challenges this narrative however, as he considers this legacy a gift, a way not only he can be with those he loves, but to be enabled and inspired by them as well. These two nuanced considerations continue to battle and meet throughout the novel as Orange ultimately uses this challenging idea of legacy to further setup his urbanized Native American narrative. </div></div>

  <div class="quote quote3">
    <span class="quotation">&ldquo;</span>3.	Without ever achieving any significant sobriety, became a certified substance abuse counselor” (106)
    <div class="dropdown-button">SEE MORE > <div class="quote-description">This quotation, describing Jacquie Red feather, highlights the novels fixation on the response to significant pain. Many challenging ideas are considered throughout this book, however much of their full impact and significance is lost during the movement of the novel. Character such as Jacquie and Daniel however, allow time to critically engage with the implications of alcoholism, loss, targeted violence, and other extreme Native American pains. This quotation exemplifies these quiet moments, as it follows Jacquie attempting to engage back with the world while still recovering from her own devastations. These spaces, littered throughout the novel allow a critical and essential glimpse into the continuation and perseverance of urbanized Native American life</div></div>
